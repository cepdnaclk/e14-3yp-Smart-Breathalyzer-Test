## Introduction

This project is mainly targeted for the Police Department in Sri Lanka. Until now they use conventional balloon test to identify drunk drivers. Providing an easy , efficient  and more secure iot based solutions replacing old conventional method our aim is to reduce the chance of escaping such situations by bribing.

Our project is to innovate a digital alcohol meter equipment communicating with a secured database-system with a user friendly GUI. We are aiming to produce two of such devices. These devices interact with the remote central server along with other local servers which will be located at regional police departments.These devices has their own ids. This method is fully automated such that the police officer has no any authority over the device. Once the police officer checks with the equipment the device automatically does everything to file a legal action against the drunk driver. And also we are developing our database such that only the higher level authority can interact with the informations. Once the data is sent to the remote server it sends a reply to the device requesting driver and vehicle informations which can be entered using the keypad included into the device itself. It is the only thing the police officer has to do.
